              Located at GammelTorv Aalborg Christmas market was founded in
              2002. Throughout the years it’s been one of the biggest Christmas
              markets in whole northland, usually containing approximately 20-30
              Christmas booths. They sell everything starting from hot wine, rum
              with tea, roasted almonds to cloths and Christmas decorations.
              They always have Christmas tree light-up at 18. november, and it’s
              always Santa Claus who arrives with his boat to light it up.
